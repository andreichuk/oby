## Usage

### `$()`

The main exported function wraps a value into an Observable, basically wrapping the value in a reactive shell.

An Observable is a function that works both as a getter and as a setter, with some extra methods attached to it, it has the following interface:

```ts
type Observable<T> = {
  (): T,
  ( value: T ): T,
  get (): T,
  sample (): T,
  set ( value: T ): T,
  update ( fn: ( value: T ) => T | void ): T,
  on <U> ( fn: ( value: T ) => U, dependencies?: Observable[] ): Observable<U>,
  on <U> ( fn: ( value: T ) => U, options?: ObservableOptions<U>, dependencies?: Observable[] ): Observable<U>
};
```

`$()` has the following interface:

```ts
type $ = <T> ( value?: T, options?: ObservableOptions<T> ) => Observable<T>;

type ObservableOptions<T> = {
  ComparatorFunction<T = unknown, TI = unknown> = ( value: T, valuePrev: T | TI ) => boolean;
};
```

This is how to use it:

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Create an Observable without an initial value

$<number>();

// Create an Observable with an initial value

$(1);

// Create an Observable with an initial value and a custom comparator

const comparator = ( value, valuePrev ) => Object.is ( value, valuePrev );

const o = $( 1, { comparator } );

// Implicit, convenient, getter

o (); // => 1

// Implicit, convenient, setter

o ( 2 ); // => 2

// "get" method for explicit getting

o.get (); // => 2

// "sample" method for explicit getting, without causing the sampled Observable to be automatically tracked as a dependency of the parent computation (read below)

o.sample (); // => 2

// "set" method for explicit setting

o.set ( 3 ); // => 3

// "update" method for setting while receiving the previous value

o.update ( prev => prev + 1 ); // => 4

// "update" method for setting by mutating the previous value, the old value is actually transparently cloned for you so it's not actually mutated

const obj = o ( { foo: { bar: true } } );

obj.update ( prev => {
  prev.foo.bar = false;
}); // => { foo: { bar: false } }

// "on" method for making an Observable out of the current Observable, this is just a potentially cleaner alternative to the `$.computed` method (see below)

const double = o.on ( value => value * value );

double (); // => 16

o ( 5 );

double (); // => 25

// "on" method, while passing it a custom comparator

o.on ( value => value * value, { comparator } );

// "on" method, while passing it a list of further dependencies to automatically track, only the explicitly listed dependencies will be automatically tracked as dependencies of the newly computed Observable (see below)

const a = $(1);
const b = $(2);
const c = $(3);
const sum = a.on ( () => a () + b () + c (), [b, c] );

sum (); // => 6

a ( 2 );

sum (); // => 7

b ( 3 );

sum (); // => 8

c ( 4 );

sum (); // => 9
```

### `$.computed`

This is the library method where the magic happens, it generates a new Observable with the result of the function passed to it, the function is automatically re-executed whenever it's dependencies change, and dependencies are tracked and disposed of automatically.

There are no restrictions, you can nest these freely, create new Observables inside them, whatever you want.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Make a new computed Observable

const a = $(1);
const b = $(2);
const c = $(3);

const sum = $.computed ( () => {
  return a () + b () + c ();
});

sum (); // => 6

a ( 2 );

sum (); // => 7

b ( 3 );

sum (); // => 8

c ( 4 );

sum (); // => 9

// Make a new computed Observable while using the previous value

const invocations = $.computed ( prev => {
  a ();
  return prev + 1;
}, 0 );

invocations (); // => 1

a ( 10 );
a ( 11 );
a ( 12 );

invocations (); // => 4
```

### `$.cleanup`

This is an essential function that allows you to register cleanup functions, which are executed automatically whenever the parent computation/effect/root is disposed of, which also happens before re-evaluating it.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Attach some cleanup functions to a computed

const callback = $( () => {} );

$.computed ( () => {

  const cb = callback ();

  document.body.addEventListener ( 'click', cb );

  $.cleanup ( () => {

    document.body.removeEventListener ( 'click', cb );

  });

  $.cleanup ( () => { // You can have as many cleanup functions as you want

    console.log ( 'cleaned up!' );

  });

});

callback ( () => {} ); // Cleanups called and computed re-evaluated
```

### `$.error`

This is an essential function that allows you to register error handler functions, which are executed automatically whenever the parent computation/effect/root throws. If any error handlers are present the error is caught automatically and is passed to error handlers. Errors bubble up.

Remember to register your error handlers before doing anything else, or the computation may throw before error handlers are registered.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Attach an error handler function to a computed

const o = $( 0 );

$.computed ( () => {

  $.error ( error => {

    console.log ( 'Error caught!' );
    console.log ( error );

  });

  if ( o () === 2 ) {

    throw new Error ( 'Some error' );

  }

});

o ( 1 ); // No error is thrown, error handlers are not called

o ( 2 ); // An error is thrown, so it's caught and passed to the registered error handlers
```

### `$.effect`

An effect is a special kind of computed, it doesn't return anything (so it uses a bit less memory), and if you return a function from inside it that's automatically registered as a cleanup function.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Create an effect with an automatically attached cleanup function

const callback = $( () => {} );

$.effect ( () => {

  const cb = callback ();

  document.body.addEventListener ( 'click', cb );

  return () => {

    document.body.removeEventListener ( 'click', cb );

  };

});

callback ( () => {} ); // Cleanups called and effect re-evaluated
```

### `$.batch`

This function holds onto updates within its scope and flushes them out at once once it exits, it's useful as a performance optimizations when updating Observables multiple times while causing other Observables/computations/effects that depend on them to be re-evaluated only once.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Batch updates

const o = $(0);

$.batch ( () => {

  o ( 1 );
  o ( 2 );
  o ( 3 );

  o (); // => 0, updates have not been flushed yet

});

o (); // => 3, now the latest update for this observable has been flushed
```

### `$.root`

This is an important function which creates a computation root, computation roots are detached from parent roots or computations and can be disposed, disposing them ends all the reactvity inside them.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Create a root and dispose of it

$.root ( dispose => {

  let calls = 0;

  const a = $(0);
  const b = $.computed ( () => {
    calls += 1;
    return a ();
  });

  calls; // => 1
  b (); // => 0

  a ( 1 );

  calls; // => 2
  b (); // => 1

  dispose (); // Now all the reactivity inside this root stops

  a ( 2 );

  calls; // => 2
  b (); // => 1
});
```

### `$.from`

This is a convenient function for encapsulating values that may change over time into an Observable. It's basically an effect that receives a brand new Observable inside it and returns it.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Encapsulating click coordinates into an Observable

const coordinates = $.from ( observable => {

  const onClick = event => {
    const coordinates = { x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY };
    observable ( coordinates );
  });

  window.addEventListener ( 'click', onClick );

  return () => {

    window.removeEventListener ( 'click', onClick );

  };

});

$.effect ( () => {

  if ( !coordinates () ) return; // It will start empty as we did not set an initial value

  console.log ( 'click at coordinates:', coordinates () );

});
```

### `$.get`

This is a convenient function for getting the value out of something, if it gets passed an Observable then it calls `.get` on it, otherwise it just returns the value.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Getting the value out of an Observable

const o = $(123);

$.get ( o ); // => 123

// Getting the value out of a non-Observable

$.get ( 123 ); // =>  123
```

### `$.sample`

This is a convenient function for computing a value out of Observables without creating dependencies on them. It's equivalent to calling `.sample` on all of them manually.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Sampling

const a = $(1);
const b = $(2);
const c = $(3);

const sum = $.sample ( () => {
  return a () + b () + c ();
});

sum; // => 6

a ( 2 );
b ( 3 );
c ( 4 );

sum; // => 6, it's just a value, not a reactive Observable
```

### `$.is`

This essential function tells you if a value is an Observable or not.

```ts
import $ from 'oby';

// Checking

$.is ( $() ); // => true
$.is ( {} ); // => false
```
